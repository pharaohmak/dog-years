# Age to Dog Years Converter

This project is a simple JavaScript application that converts a person's age into dog years. It takes the user's name and age as input, calculates the equivalent age in dog years, and displays the result on the webpage.

## Project Description

The Age to Dog Years Converter is a basic web application designed to demonstrate how to interact with HTML elements using JavaScript. It uses the values from input fields to perform calculations and dynamically update the content on the page. The conversion logic takes into account that the first two years of a dog's life count as 10.5 dog years each, and each subsequent year counts as 4 dog years.
